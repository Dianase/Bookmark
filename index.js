//The bookmark app allows users to pin their favorite website to the app by [INPUT URL], 
//adding a brief [DESCRIPTION] of the pinned website, giving it [TITLE] and a [1-5 RATING].
//The initial state of the app will display saved bookmarks and the form for adding new bookmarks
//When the user inserts all required fields in the input then they can press the save button 
//Once the user hits the save button a button will be generated and rendered to the DOM that holds the bookmarked url and information about the bookmark
//The bookmark display button will only show the title and the rating of the bookmark
//When the saved bookmark button is clicked the view expands and shows the description section and a ["VISIT SITE"] link
//additionally, the expanded view displays a [DELETE BOOKMARK] button






//This function will put all the content on the page
function renderBookmarkApp(){

//This function will take the user's input and put it in an object that holds all values
